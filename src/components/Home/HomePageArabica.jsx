        <p className="home-page__arabica-text">
          Compared to Robusta coffee beans which often have a burnt-rubber taste
          and quality, Arabica beans are delicate, well-rounded, aromatic, and
          can be grown and processed in different ways to instill a variety of
          flavors. The choice for us was easy. We only use 100% of the finest
          quality Arabica beans at J.CO.
        </p>
        <p className="home-page__arabica-text">
          Whatever your mood is, weâ€™ve roasted them to a perfect medium to
          extract a well-balanced flavor profile from each bean.
